- Always use pnpm.
- Use tailwind
- Always use arrow functions.
- If you want to create a new interface, make sure that you cannot use Prisma Generated types.
- If you are going to use the same interface twice move it to a folder called types. so you can import it from there.
- Always use shadcn ui components.
- When creating a function that takes in more than 2 parameters always make this one param but an object containing all the params.
know that next params are now a promise you have to await them
